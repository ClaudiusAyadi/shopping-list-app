# Shopping List

This is my first project in Javascript. I took up the language over the weekend and I'm really loving it.

This is a very basic project that allows a user to create a shopping list and stores the list on the user's browser.

So the storage is persistent as long as the user doesn't clear out localStorage. That is when you clear history or cache.

Hope to build awesome projects down the road. Thanks for testing out my first project. I will keep sharing more cool projects as I learn.
